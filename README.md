# Solidity Examples

This is a compilation of Solidity examples that I worked on while learning about Solidity and developing smart contracts.

Nearly all the smart contracts are accompanied by tests, so feel free to experiment with them to gain a deeper understanding of the Solidity programming language and the business logic within the contracts themselves.

## Contributors

We enthusiastically welcome pull requests from all contributors. By actively participating in submitting examples, we firmly believe that others will find them invaluable when embarking on their Solidity journey.
