# Solidity Examples

This is a compilation of Solidity examples that I worked on while learning about Solidity and developing smart contracts.

Nearly all the smart contracts are accompanied by tests, so feel free to experiment with them to gain a deeper understanding of the Solidity programming language and the business logic within the contracts themselves.
